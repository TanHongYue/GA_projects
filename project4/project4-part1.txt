Problem Statement: 
Predict if the client of the bank will subscribe to a term deposit (Yes/No). Binary Outcome. 

Assumptions:
1. As there is no customer ID indicated in the dataset, assume that each row represents an unique client 
2. “Last contact duration” variable will be dropped from model training, as suggested by the data provider 
“Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.”

Goals and success metrics:
Goal of the model is to accurately predict if a client will take up a term deposit with the bank, given the attributes. 
Clustering can first be performed to identify distinct customer groups within the dataset. 
Then model classifiers like logistic regression/CART/random forest/Support Vector Machines/Neural Networks can be trained for prediction.
